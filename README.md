# Bedrock Books

Bedrock Books is a mod that simply changes the book screen to look more like the one seen in Bedrock Edition, all while remaining 100% client side!

_Note: this is not a fully 100% accurate port, some aspects have been slightly adapted and adjusted to better fit with how books work on Java Edition_

## Features

- Fully client side, will work on any server modded or vanilla
- Compatible with all pre-existing books
- Configurable, can change keybinds or toggle certain features to your liking
- Pages can be moved or deleted in the book writing screen just like Bedrock Edition
- Lectern screens have a 'bookmark' which indicates which page players without the mod will see, more info below

## Compatability

As mentioned above, this mod will not interfere with the way any pre-existing books look (aside from there being two pages visible instead of one of course). The area where text is displayed is exactly the same size as vanilla meaning the layout of pages will look the same with or without this mod.

This mod does not modify any save data or anything server-side, it is a purely visual change so you can safely use it on servers or uninstall it whenever you wish without losing any data.

If you need to access the vanilla book screens for whatever reason, you can enable a keybind from the config menu. With this enabled, opening a book while holding they keybind will display the vanilla book screen instead of Bedrock Book's custom screen.

## Lecterns

Lectern screens will show a 'bookmark', this indicates the page that the server or other players see. This feature allows you to fine tune redstone power levels just like you can in vanilla Java Edition using lecterns. Additionally this makes sure vanilla players can read a book on a lectern properly, as otherwise they would effectively skip a page if a player with this mod turned to the next page.
